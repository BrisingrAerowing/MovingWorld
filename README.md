# MovingWorld Plus

>>**What is MovingWorld Plus:** MovingWorld Plus is essentially an attempt to make MovingWorld redux but not assume all the old MovingWorld legacy code is trash. Yes a lot of it is, but not all of it is utter garbage the ModContainer is pretty nice.

>>**Why does this exist:** Experimentation mostly, see how far I can push the current codebase, remove the MobileChunk nonsense and replace it with something more... reasonable. Dont re-render the entire entity every frame from scratch, etc.

>>**Will this go anywhere:** Probably not, I want to use this more as a learning tool than anything else. If it does end up going somewhere, great.
