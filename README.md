# MovingWorld-REDUX

MovingWorld Redux is a version of MovingWorld being written from scratch, the original is far too buggy and I think it would be best for a library like this to be licensed in a more fair way (So, Apache-2 :)).

Here are MovingWorld Redux's goals:

* Moving Player made structures (duh)
* Smooth transitions between world and moving world
* Fully functioning worlds, tiles, pistons, etc.
* Be more friendly to the open source community
