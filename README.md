# MovingWorld-REDUX

MovingWorld REDUX is a version of MovingWorld being written from scratch, the original is far too buggy and I think it
would be best for a library like this to be licensed in a more fair way, so we're under Apache 2.0.

Here are MovingWorld REDUX's goals:

* Moving Player made structures (duh)
* Smooth transitions between world and moving world
* Fully functioning worlds so tiles, guis, etc will all work.
* Be more friendly to the open source community (Apache 2.0)
